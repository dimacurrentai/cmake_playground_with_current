## CMake + Current Playground

In `src/`:

* `hw0.cc`: a simple "Hello, World!"
* `hw1.cc`: depends on a header file, rebuilds when the header file changes.
* `hw2.cc`: uses `dflags` and greets `--name`.
* `hw3.cc`: needs `current_build.h`, generated by a special `cmake` target.
* `hw4.cc`: links against a library, which is built from its own source file.
